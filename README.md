# About cpp-homeworks

## Origin

As the name entails, this is collection of Homework assignments I sent in while I was a student in university.
The prompts for these assignments have since been lost to time.
Sadly at the time, I had wrongly counted on the website still being available, though little did I know, the professor was nearing retirement.

## General Themes

As the assignments go on, it will become more clear that references to The Simpsons happpens a lot.
This, is funnily not by my choice, as the assignments given by the professor integrated these elements into the course's homework assignment prompts.
