Upon a successful run of the program, an output
similar to the following will print to the console:

f(x,y): result  f(x,y+1): result  f(x,y+2): result ...
f(x,y): result  f(x+1,y): result  f(x+2,y): result ...

x will represent the amount of animal parts used.
y will represent the number of types of animals used.

The output uses the values given by the user to
evaluate the profit equation for every integer value
of x and y in the range of values for x and y.

Example:
  f(2,1): 1.21

This evaluates the projected profit if 2 animal parts are used,
from 1 type of animal.
